stack<T>:: clear() â€” the clear function has a runtime complexity of O(n) because it runs until every T element of the stack is popped off the top. So if there are 1000 elements, it would run 1000 times. There is not possible way to reduce this runtime complexity, however the storage of the stack could affect the runtime OUTCOME as cache storage would have a quicker runtime than a disk read of a hard drive.
